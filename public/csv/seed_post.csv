  <div><br></div><div>At the beginning of April, our teacher said to us, “I want you to do two things while you are young.</div><div> “The first thing is to go to a foreign country and make friends with people there. You will learn different ideas and thoughts of the people. When I was in university, I went to America to study, and I made a lot of good friends with Americans and exchange students from many countries. Through those friends, I learned more about their countries and their ways of thinking.</div><div> “The second thing is to study a foreign language. And also, I want you to learn about the culture behind that language. It’s important to study foreign language and use it, but that’s not enough. When I was in America, I really understood the meanings of words when I learned more about their culture.<br><br>問題１ </div><ol><li>Why does this teacher want his student to go to  foreign countries ?</li></ol><div>

  <div><br></div><div>	The orangutan is the only big ape in Asia ( apes are gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and  so on). “Orangutan” means “man of the forest” in Indonesian and Malay. Today orangutans are in danger. They are losing their homes because people are  cutting down the forests to sell wood or to make farms. Many forests for orangutans are disappearing.</div><div>	There is another thing to think about. Young orangutans in the forests are caught and sold. They are raised as pets by some people incites. But after several years, they become difficult animals for these	people. They got so big and strong that the people can’t take care of them at home. So they are thrown away. </div><div>	Those orangutans are sent to rehabilitation centers. There, they have to learn some things before they go back to the forests again. They must learn how to climb up trees and where to get food. If they can’t learn these things, they can’t live in the forests. We should save the orangutan’s home and life in the forests.<br><br>解答シート<br><a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/10yNEiOAe4CGQoWpeE1kWK7RHh6R6Rv-hKMuUZC9LYjM/edit?usp=sharing"">https://docs.google.com/document/d/10yNEiOAe4CGQoWpeE1kWK7RHh6R6Rv-hKMuUZC9LYjM/edit?usp=sharing</a>
